# Anime-data-analysis
📊 Project Overview

This project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on an Anime dataset using Python. The process involved data cleaning (handling null values, correcting data types, and filling unknown values), feature understanding, and visualization using libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
Through visual analysis, I explored relationships between anime ratings, popularity, genre distribution, and episode counts. The project aims to identify which types of anime perform best, analyze audience trends, and provide meaningful insights for anime fans or recommendation system developers.

🏆 Results & Achievements

Successfully cleaned and preprocessed the dataset by handling missing values and converting data types.

Visualized key patterns like the distribution of ratings, popularity, and genre frequency.

Found that TV-type anime dominated the dataset, while genres like Action, Comedy, and Adventure were the most common.

Observed that anime with fewer episodes often received higher average ratings, indicating viewer preference for concise, impactful shows.

Created clear, data-driven visualizations to highlight these trends effectively.
